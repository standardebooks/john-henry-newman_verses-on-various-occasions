				<span><strong>There</strong> is in stillness oft a magic power</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To calm the breast, when struggling passions lower;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Touch'd by its influence, in the soul arise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Diviner feelings, kindred with the skies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By this the Arab's kindling thoughts expand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When circling skies inclose the desert sand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For this the hermit seeks the thickest grove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To catch th' inspiring glow of heavenly love.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It is not solely in the freedom given</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To purify and fix the heart on heaven;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There is a Spirit singing aye in air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That lifts us high above all mortal care.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No mortal measure swells that mystic sound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No mortal minstrel breathes such tones around,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Angels' hymn,—the sovereign harmony</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That guides the rolling orbs along the sky,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hence perchance the tales of saints who view'd</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And heard Angelic choirs in solitude.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By most unheard,—because the earthly din</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of toil or mirth has charms their ears to win.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alas for man! he knows not of the bliss,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The heaven that brightens such a life as this.</span>

				<span>O <strong>that</strong> Thou wouldest rend the breadth of sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That veils Thy presence from the sons of men!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O that, as erst Thou camest from on high</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sudden in strength, Thou so would'st come again!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Track'd out by judgments was Thy fiery path,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ocean and mountain withering in Thy wrath!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then would Thy name—the Just, the Merciful—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Strange dubious attributes to human mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Appal Thy foes; and, kings, who spurn Thy rule,</span>

				<span class="i1">Then, then would quake to hopeless doom consign'd.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>See, the stout bows, and totters the secure,</span>

				<span>While pleasure's bondsman hides his head impure!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come down! for then shall from its seven bright</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him who thirsts the draught of life be given;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eye hath not seen, ear hath not heard the things</span>

				<span class="i1">Which He hath purposed for the heirs of heaven,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A God of love, guiding with gracious ray</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each meek rejoicing pilgrim on his way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yea, though we err, and Thine averted face</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rebukes the folly in Thine Israel done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will not that hour of chastisement give place</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To beams, the pledge of an eternal sun?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yes! for His counsels to the end endure;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We shall be saved, our rest abideth sure.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lord, Lord! our sins ... our sins ... unclean are we,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gross and corrupt; our seeming-virtuous deeds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are but abominate; all, dead to Thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shrivel, like leaves when summer's green recedes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While, like the autumn blast, our lusts arise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sweep their prey where the fell serpent lies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>None, there is none to plead with God in prayer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bracing his laggart spirit to the work</span>

				<span>Thou, as the potter, with a Hand Divine,</span>

				<span class="i1">Didst mould Thy vessels of the sluggish clay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mark not our guilt, Thy word of wrath recall,</span>

				<span>Lo, we are Thine by price, Thy people all!</span>

				<span>Alas for Zion! 'tis a waste;—the fair,</span>

				<span>Kindled the sacrifice of praise and prayer,</span>

				<span class="i1">Far other brightness gleams from Gentile fires.</span>

			<p>
				<span><strong>Dear</strong> Frank, this morn has usher'd in</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">The manhood of thy days;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A boy no more, thou must begin</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">To choose thy future ways;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To brace thy arm, and nerve thy heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For maintenance of a noble part.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And thou a voucher fair hast given,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Of what thou wilt achieve,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere age has dimm'd thy sun-lit heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">In weary life's chill eve;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should Sovereign Wisdom in its grace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vouchsafe to thee so long a race.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>My brother, we are link'd with chain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">That time shall ne'er destroy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Together we have been in pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Together now in joy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For duly I to share may claim</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The present brightness of thy name,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>My brother, 'tis no recent tie</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Which binds our fates in one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>E'en from our tender infancy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">The twisted thread was spun;—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her deed, who stored in her fond mind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our forms, by sacred love enshrined.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In her affection all had share,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">All six, she loved them all;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet on her early-chosen Pair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Did her full favour fall;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2" id="noteref-2" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And we became her dearest theme,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her waking thought, her nightly dream.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ah! brother, shall we e'er forget</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Her love, her care, her zeal?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We cannot pay the countless debt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">But we must ever feel;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For through her earnestness were shed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Prayer-purchased blessings on our head.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Though in the end of days she stood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">And pain and weakness came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her force of thought was unsubdued,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Her fire of love the same;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And e'en when memory fail'd its part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We still kept lodgment in her heart.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And when her Maker from the thrall</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Of flesh her spirit freed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No suffering companied the call,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">—In mercy 'twas decreed,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One moment here, the next she trod</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The viewless mansion of her God.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now then at length she is at rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">And, after many a woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rejoices in that Saviour blest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Who was her hope below;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kept till the day when He shall own</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His saints before His Father's throne.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So it is left for us to prove</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Her prayers were not in vain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that God's grace-according love</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Has come as gentle rain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which, falling in the vernal hour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tints the young leaf, perfumes the flower.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Dear Frank, we both are summon'd now</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">As champions of the Lord;—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enroll'd am I, and shortly thou</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Must buckle on thy sword;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A high employ, nor lightly given,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To serve as messengers of heaven!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Deep in my heart that gift I hide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">I change it not away</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For patriot-warrior's hour of pride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Or statesman's tranquil sway;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For poet's fire, or pleader's skill</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To pierce the soul and tame the will.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O! may we follow undismay'd</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Where'er our God shall call!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And may His Spirit's present aid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Uphold us lest we fall!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till in the end of days we stand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As victors in a deathless land.</span>

			<p>
				<span>Art's labour'd toys of highest name</span>

				<span class="i2">And suns embrown its grain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such prospect is to me right dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For freedom, health, and joy are here.</span>

			<p>
				<span>There is a spirit ranging through</span>

				<span>Ten thousand shapes, garbs ever new,</span>

				<span>The energy of Life is found.</span>

			<p>
				<span>Now dewy rain descends, and now</span>

				<span class="i2">Brisk showers the welkin shroud;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I care not, though with angry brow</span>

				<span class="i2">Frowns the red thunder-cloud;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let hail-storm pelt, and lightning harm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>'Tis Nature's work, and has its charm.</span>

				<span>Not laboured into sudden heat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">But inly born anew.—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So living Nature, not dull Art,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall plan my ways and rule my heart.</span>

				<span>I <strong>am</strong> rooted in the wall</span>

				<span>Of buttress'd tower or ancient hall;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Prison'd in an art-wrought bed.</span>
				<br/>

				<br/>
				<span>Of a living stock alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brother of the lifeless stone.</span>

				<span>Else unprized, I have my worth</span>

				<span>They, proud hearts, a home reject</span>

				<span>Humble-I can bear to dwell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Near the pale recluse's cell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I spread my crimson bloom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mingled with the cloister's gloom.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Life's gay gifts and honours rare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flowers of favour! win and wear!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rose of beauty, be the queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In pleasure's ring and festive scene.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ivy, climb and cluster, where</span>

				<span>Vaunt, fair Lily, stately dame,</span>

				<span>Pride of birth and pomp of name.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Miser Crocus, starved with cold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hide in earth thy timid gold.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Travell'd Dahlia, freely boast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Knowledge brought from foreign coast.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pleasure, wealth, birth, knowledge, power,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These have each an emblem flower;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So for me alone remains</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lowly thought and cheerful pains.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be it mine to set restraint</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On roving wish and selfish plaint;</span>

				<span>And for man's drear haunts to leave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dewy morn and balmy eve.</span>

				<br/>
				<span>Of human works the rugged face.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mine, the Unseen to display</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the crowded public way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where life's busy arts combine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To shut out the Hand Divine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ah! no more a scentless flower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By approving Heaven's high power,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Suddenly my leaves exhale</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fragrance of the Syrian gale.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ah! 'tis timely comfort given</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By the answering breath of Heaven!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May it be! then well might I</span>

				<span>In College cloister live and die.</span>

				<span><strong>In</strong> childhood, when with eager eyes</span>

				<span class="i2">All, garb'd in fairy guise,</span>

			</p>
			<p>

				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Even suns o'er autumn's bowers</span>

				<span>They came and went, the short-lived four;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet, as their varying dance they wove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">To my young heart each bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Its own sure claim of love.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Far different now;—the whirling year</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Vainly my dizzy eyes pursue;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">And its fair tints appear</span>

				<span class="i3">All blent in one dusk hue.</span>

				<span class="i2">Long days are fire-side nights,</span>

				<span><strong>Death</strong> was full urgent with thee, Sister dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">And startling in his speed;—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brief pain, then languor till thy end came near—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">Such was the path decreed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i8">The hurried road</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To lead thy soul from earth to thine own God's abode.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Death wrought with thee, sweet maid, impatiently:—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">Yet merciful the haste</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That baffles sickness;—dearest, thou didst die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">Thou wast not made to taste</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i8">Death's bitterness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Decline's slow-wasting charm, or fever's fierce distress.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Death came unheralded:—but it was well;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">For so thy Saviour bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kind witness, thou wast meet at once to dwell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">On His eternal shore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i8">All warning spared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For none He gives where hearts are for prompt change prepared.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Death wrought in mystery; both complaint and cure</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">To human skill unknown:—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>God put aside all means, to make us sure</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">It was His deed alone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i8">Lest we should lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reproach on our poor selves, that thou wast caught away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Death urged as scant of time:—lest, Sister dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">We many a lingering day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had sicken'd with alternate hope and fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">The ague of delay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i8">Watching each spark</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of promise quench'd in turn, till all our sky was dark.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Death came and went:—that so thy image might</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">Our yearning hearts possess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Associate with all pleasant thoughts and bright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">With youth and loveliness;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i8">Sorrow can claim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mary, nor lot nor part in thy soft soothing name.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Joy of sad hearts, and light of downcast eyes!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">Dearest thou art enshrined</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In all thy fragrance in our memories;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">For we must ever find</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i8">Bare thought of thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Freshen this weary life, while weary life shall be.</span>

				<span>The pensive brow, the world might see</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When she in crowds was found;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The burst of heart, the o'erflowing glee</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When only friends were round;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Hope's warmth of promise, prompt to fill</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The thoughts with good in store,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Match'd with content's deep stream, which still</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Flow'd on, when hope was o'er;</span>

				<span>Proving her heart's self-mastering power</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Blithely to part with all,—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>All her eye loved, all her hand press'd</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With keen affection's glow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The voice of home, all pleasures best,</span>

			<p>
				<span>From friend-lit hearth, from social board,</span>

				<span class="i1">All duteously she rose;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For faith upon the Master's word</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Can find a sure repose.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And in her wonder up she sped,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And tried relief in vain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then laid her down upon her bed</span>
