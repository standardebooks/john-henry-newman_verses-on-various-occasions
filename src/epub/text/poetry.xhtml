				<span>There is in stillness oft a magic power</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To calm the breast, when struggling passions lower;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Touch'd by its influence, in the soul arise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Diviner feelings, kindred with the skies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By this the Arab's kindling thoughts expand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When circling skies inclose the desert sand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For this the hermit seeks the thickest grove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To catch th' inspiring glow of heavenly love.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It is not solely in the freedom given</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To purify and fix the heart on heaven;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There is a Spirit singing aye in air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That lifts us high above all mortal care.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No mortal measure swells that mystic sound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No mortal minstrel breathes such tones around,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Angels' hymn,—the sovereign harmony</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That guides the rolling orbs along the sky,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hence perchance the tales of saints who view'd</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And heard Angelic choirs in solitude.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By most unheard,—because the earthly din</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of toil or mirth has charms their ears to win.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alas for man! he knows not of the bliss,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The heaven that brightens such a life as this.</span>

				<span>O that Thou wouldest rend the breadth of sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That veils Thy presence from the sons of men!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O that, as erst Thou camest from on high</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sudden in strength, Thou so would'st come again!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Track'd out by judgments was Thy fiery path,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ocean and mountain withering in Thy wrath!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then would Thy name—the Just, the Merciful—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Strange dubious attributes to human mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Appal Thy foes; and, kings, who spurn Thy rule,</span>

				<span class="i1">Then, then would quake to hopeless doom consign'd.</span>
				<br/>

				<span>While pleasure's bondsman hides his head impure!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come down! for then shall from its seven bright</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him who thirsts the draught of life be given;</span>

				<span>Eye hath not seen, ear hath not heard the things</span>

				<span class="i1">Which He hath purposed for the heirs of heaven,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A God of love, guiding with gracious ray</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each meek rejoicing pilgrim on his way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yea, though we err, and Thine averted face</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rebukes the folly in Thine Israel done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will not that hour of chastisement give place</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To beams, the pledge of an eternal sun?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yes! for His counsels to the end endure;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We shall be saved, our rest abideth sure.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lord, Lord! our sins ... our sins ... unclean are we,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gross and corrupt; our seeming-virtuous deeds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are but abominate; all, dead to Thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shrivel, like leaves when summer's green recedes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While, like the autumn blast, our lusts arise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sweep their prey where the fell serpent lies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>None, there is none to plead with God in prayer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bracing his laggart spirit to the work</span>

				<span>Of intercession; conscience-sprung despair,</span>

				<span>Thou, as the potter, with a Hand Divine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Didst mould Thy vessels of the sluggish clay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mark not our guilt, Thy word of wrath recall,</span>

				<span>Lo, we are Thine by price, Thy people all!</span>
			</p>

				<span>Alas for Zion! 'tis a waste;—the fair,</span>

				<span>Kindled the sacrifice of praise and prayer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Far other brightness gleams from Gentile fires.</span>

			<p>
				<span>Dear Frank, this morn has usher'd in</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">The manhood of thy days;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A boy no more, thou must begin</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">To choose thy future ways;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To brace thy arm, and nerve thy heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For maintenance of a noble part.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And thou a voucher fair hast given,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Of what thou wilt achieve,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere age has dimm'd thy sun-lit heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">In weary life's chill eve;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should Sovereign Wisdom in its grace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vouchsafe to thee so long a race.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>My brother, we are link'd with chain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">That time shall ne'er destroy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Together we have been in pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Together now in joy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For duly I to share may claim</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The present brightness of thy name,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>My brother, 'tis no recent tie</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Which binds our fates in one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>E'en from our tender infancy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">The twisted thread was spun;—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her deed, who stored in her fond mind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our forms, by sacred love enshrined.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In her affection all had share,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">All six, she loved them all;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet on her early-chosen Pair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Did her full favour fall;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2" id="noteref-2" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And we became her dearest theme,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her waking thought, her nightly dream.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ah! brother, shall we e'er forget</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Her love, her care, her zeal?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We cannot pay the countless debt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">But we must ever feel;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For through her earnestness were shed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Prayer-purchased blessings on our head.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Though in the end of days she stood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">And pain and weakness came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her force of thought was unsubdued,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Her fire of love the same;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And e'en when memory fail'd its part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We still kept lodgment in her heart.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And when her Maker from the thrall</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Of flesh her spirit freed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No suffering companied the call,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">—In mercy 'twas decreed,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One moment here, the next she trod</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The viewless mansion of her God.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now then at length she is at rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">And, after many a woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rejoices in that Saviour blest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Who was her hope below;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kept till the day when He shall own</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His saints before His Father's throne.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So it is left for us to prove</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Her prayers were not in vain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that God's grace-according love</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Has come as gentle rain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which, falling in the vernal hour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tints the young leaf, perfumes the flower.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Dear Frank, we both are summon'd now</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">As champions of the Lord;—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enroll'd am I, and shortly thou</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Must buckle on thy sword;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A high employ, nor lightly given,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To serve as messengers of heaven!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Deep in my heart that gift I hide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">I change it not away</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For patriot-warrior's hour of pride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Or statesman's tranquil sway;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For poet's fire, or pleader's skill</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To pierce the soul and tame the will.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O! may we follow undismay'd</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Where'er our God shall call!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And may His Spirit's present aid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Uphold us lest we fall!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till in the end of days we stand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As victors in a deathless land.</span>

				<span class="i2">Unroll her gorgeous plan;</span>

				<span>I cannot bear those sullen walls,</span>

				<span>Those eyeless towers, those tongueless halls.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Art's labour'd toys of highest name</span>

				<span class="i2">A coffin or a tomb;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well suits, when sense is pass'd away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such lifeless works the lifeless clay.</span>

				<br/>
				<span>While cattle bank its winding rills,</span>

				<span class="i2">And suns embrown its grain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such prospect is to me right dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For freedom, health, and joy are here.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There is a spirit ranging through</span>

				<span class="i2">The earth, the stream, the air;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ten thousand shapes, garbs ever new,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">That busy One doth wear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In colour, scent, and taste, and sound</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The energy of Life is found.</span>

			<p>
				<span>The leaves are rustling in the breeze,</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i2">The sunbeam glides along;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The insect, happy in its hour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Floats softly by, or sips the flower.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now dewy rain descends, and now</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Brisk showers the welkin shroud;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I care not, though with angry brow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Frowns the red thunder-cloud;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let hail-storm pelt, and lightning harm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>'Tis Nature's work, and has its charm.</span>
			</p>
			<p>

				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Full favour'd in thy court;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I of thy smiles but hear them tell,</span>

				<span class="i2">The sameness of its sway;</span>
				<span>Where iron rule, stern precedent,</span>
				<span class="i2">Mistreat the graceful day;</span>
				<span>To pine as prisoner in his cell,</span>
				<span>And yet be thought to love it well.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet so His high dispose has set,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Who binds on each his part;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though absent, I may cherish yet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">An Ulcombe of the heart;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Calm verdant hope divinely given,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And suns of peace, and scenes of heaven;—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A soul prepared His will to meet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Full fix'd His work to do;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not laboured into sudden heat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">But inly born anew.—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So living Nature, not dull Art,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall plan my ways and rule my heart.</span>
