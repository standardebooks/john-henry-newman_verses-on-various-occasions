				<span>There is in stillness oft a magic power</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To calm the breast, when struggling passions lower;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Touch'd by its influence, in the soul arise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Diviner feelings, kindred with the skies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By this the Arab's kindling thoughts expand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When circling skies inclose the desert sand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For this the hermit seeks the thickest grove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To catch th' inspiring glow of heavenly love.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It is not solely in the freedom given</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To purify and fix the heart on heaven;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There is a Spirit singing aye in air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That lifts us high above all mortal care.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No mortal measure swells that mystic sound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No mortal minstrel breathes such tones around,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Angels' hymn,—the sovereign harmony</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That guides the rolling orbs along the sky,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hence perchance the tales of saints who view'd</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And heard Angelic choirs in solitude.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By most unheard,—because the earthly din</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of toil or mirth has charms their ears to win.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alas for man! he knows not of the bliss,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The heaven that brightens such a life as this.</span>

				<span>O that Thou wouldest rend the breadth of sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That veils Thy presence from the sons of men!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O that, as erst Thou camest from on high</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sudden in strength, Thou so would'st come again!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Track'd out by judgments was Thy fiery path,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ocean and mountain withering in Thy wrath!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then would Thy name—the Just, the Merciful—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Strange dubious attributes to human mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Appal Thy foes; and, kings, who spurn Thy rule,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then, then would quake to hopeless doom consign'd.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>See, the stout bows, and totters the secure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While pleasure's bondsman hides his head impure!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come down! for then shall from its seven bright</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him who thirsts the draught of life be given;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eye hath not seen, ear hath not heard the things</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which He hath purposed for the heirs of heaven,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A God of love, guiding with gracious ray</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each meek rejoicing pilgrim on his way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yea, though we err, and Thine averted face</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rebukes the folly in Thine Israel done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will not that hour of chastisement give place</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To beams, the pledge of an eternal sun?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yes! for His counsels to the end endure;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We shall be saved, our rest abideth sure.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lord, Lord! our sins ... our sins ... unclean are we,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gross and corrupt; our seeming-virtuous deeds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are but abominate; all, dead to Thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shrivel, like leaves when summer's green recedes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While, like the autumn blast, our lusts arise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sweep their prey where the fell serpent lies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>None, there is none to plead with God in prayer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bracing his laggart spirit to the work</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of intercession; conscience-sprung despair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sin-loving still, doth in each bosom lurk.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Guilt calls Thee to avenge;—Thy risen ire</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sears like a brand, we gaze and we expire.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But now, O Lord, our Father! we are Thine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Design and fashion; senseless while we lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou, as the potter, with a Hand Divine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Didst mould Thy vessels of the sluggish clay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mark not our guilt, Thy word of wrath recall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lo, we are Thine by price, Thy people all!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Alas for Zion! 'tis a waste;—the fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The holy place in flames;—where once our sires</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kindled the sacrifice of praise and prayer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Far other brightness gleams from Gentile fires.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Low lies our pride;—and wilt Thou self-deny</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy rescuing arm unvex'd amid thine Israel's cry?</span>
