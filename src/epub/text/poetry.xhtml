				<span>There is in stillness oft a magic power</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To calm the breast, when struggling passions lower;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Touch'd by its influence, in the soul arise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Diviner feelings, kindred with the skies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By this the Arab's kindling thoughts expand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When circling skies inclose the desert sand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For this the hermit seeks the thickest grove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To catch th' inspiring glow of heavenly love.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It is not solely in the freedom given</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To purify and fix the heart on heaven;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There is a Spirit singing aye in air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That lifts us high above all mortal care.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No mortal measure swells that mystic sound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No mortal minstrel breathes such tones around,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Angels' hymn,—the sovereign harmony</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That guides the rolling orbs along the sky,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hence perchance the tales of saints who view'd</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And heard Angelic choirs in solitude.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By most unheard,—because the earthly din</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of toil or mirth has charms their ears to win.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alas for man! he knows not of the bliss,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The heaven that brightens such a life as this.</span>

					<span>Albeit in rude, in heartfelt strains to praise</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My God, for He hath shielded wondrously</span>

					<span>With riot throng, and feast, and greetings loud,</span>

					<span>What! joy because the fulness of the year</span>

					<span class="i1">Marks thee for greedy death a riper prey?</span>
