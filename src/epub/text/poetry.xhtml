				<span><strong>There</strong> is in stillness oft a magic power</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To calm the breast, when struggling passions lower;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Touch'd by its influence, in the soul arise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Diviner feelings, kindred with the skies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By this the Arab's kindling thoughts expand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When circling skies inclose the desert sand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For this the hermit seeks the thickest grove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To catch th' inspiring glow of heavenly love.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It is not solely in the freedom given</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To purify and fix the heart on heaven;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There is a Spirit singing aye in air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That lifts us high above all mortal care.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No mortal measure swells that mystic sound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No mortal minstrel breathes such tones around,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Angels' hymn,—the sovereign harmony</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That guides the rolling orbs along the sky,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hence perchance the tales of saints who view'd</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And heard Angelic choirs in solitude.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By most unheard,—because the earthly din</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of toil or mirth has charms their ears to win.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alas for man! he knows not of the bliss,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The heaven that brightens such a life as this.</span>

				<span>O <strong>that</strong> Thou wouldest rend the breadth of sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That veils Thy presence from the sons of men!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O that, as erst Thou camest from on high</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sudden in strength, Thou so would'st come again!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Track'd out by judgments was Thy fiery path,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ocean and mountain withering in Thy wrath!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then would Thy name—the Just, the Merciful—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Strange dubious attributes to human mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Appal Thy foes; and, kings, who spurn Thy rule,</span>

				<span class="i1">Then, then would quake to hopeless doom consign'd.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>See, the stout bows, and totters the secure,</span>

				<span>While pleasure's bondsman hides his head impure!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come down! for then shall from its seven bright</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him who thirsts the draught of life be given;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eye hath not seen, ear hath not heard the things</span>

				<span class="i1">Which He hath purposed for the heirs of heaven,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A God of love, guiding with gracious ray</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each meek rejoicing pilgrim on his way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yea, though we err, and Thine averted face</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rebukes the folly in Thine Israel done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will not that hour of chastisement give place</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To beams, the pledge of an eternal sun?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yes! for His counsels to the end endure;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We shall be saved, our rest abideth sure.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lord, Lord! our sins ... our sins ... unclean are we,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gross and corrupt; our seeming-virtuous deeds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are but abominate; all, dead to Thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shrivel, like leaves when summer's green recedes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While, like the autumn blast, our lusts arise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sweep their prey where the fell serpent lies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>None, there is none to plead with God in prayer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bracing his laggart spirit to the work</span>

				<span>Thou, as the potter, with a Hand Divine,</span>

				<span class="i1">Didst mould Thy vessels of the sluggish clay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mark not our guilt, Thy word of wrath recall,</span>

				<span>Lo, we are Thine by price, Thy people all!</span>

				<span>Alas for Zion! 'tis a waste;—the fair,</span>

				<span>Kindled the sacrifice of praise and prayer,</span>

				<span class="i1">Far other brightness gleams from Gentile fires.</span>

			<p>
				<span><strong>Dear</strong> Frank, this morn has usher'd in</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">The manhood of thy days;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A boy no more, thou must begin</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">To choose thy future ways;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To brace thy arm, and nerve thy heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For maintenance of a noble part.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And thou a voucher fair hast given,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Of what thou wilt achieve,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere age has dimm'd thy sun-lit heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">In weary life's chill eve;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should Sovereign Wisdom in its grace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vouchsafe to thee so long a race.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>My brother, we are link'd with chain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">That time shall ne'er destroy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Together we have been in pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Together now in joy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For duly I to share may claim</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The present brightness of thy name,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>My brother, 'tis no recent tie</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Which binds our fates in one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>E'en from our tender infancy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">The twisted thread was spun;—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her deed, who stored in her fond mind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our forms, by sacred love enshrined.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In her affection all had share,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">All six, she loved them all;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet on her early-chosen Pair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Did her full favour fall;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2" id="noteref-2" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And we became her dearest theme,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her waking thought, her nightly dream.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ah! brother, shall we e'er forget</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Her love, her care, her zeal?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We cannot pay the countless debt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">But we must ever feel;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For through her earnestness were shed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Prayer-purchased blessings on our head.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Though in the end of days she stood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">And pain and weakness came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her force of thought was unsubdued,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Her fire of love the same;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And e'en when memory fail'd its part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We still kept lodgment in her heart.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And when her Maker from the thrall</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Of flesh her spirit freed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No suffering companied the call,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">—In mercy 'twas decreed,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One moment here, the next she trod</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The viewless mansion of her God.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now then at length she is at rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">And, after many a woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rejoices in that Saviour blest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Who was her hope below;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kept till the day when He shall own</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His saints before His Father's throne.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So it is left for us to prove</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Her prayers were not in vain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that God's grace-according love</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Has come as gentle rain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which, falling in the vernal hour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tints the young leaf, perfumes the flower.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Dear Frank, we both are summon'd now</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">As champions of the Lord;—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enroll'd am I, and shortly thou</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Must buckle on thy sword;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A high employ, nor lightly given,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To serve as messengers of heaven!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Deep in my heart that gift I hide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">I change it not away</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For patriot-warrior's hour of pride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Or statesman's tranquil sway;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For poet's fire, or pleader's skill</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To pierce the soul and tame the will.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O! may we follow undismay'd</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Where'er our God shall call!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And may His Spirit's present aid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Uphold us lest we fall!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till in the end of days we stand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As victors in a deathless land.</span>

			<p>
				<span>Art's labour'd toys of highest name</span>

				<span class="i2">And suns embrown its grain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such prospect is to me right dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For freedom, health, and joy are here.</span>

			<p>
				<span>There is a spirit ranging through</span>

				<span>Ten thousand shapes, garbs ever new,</span>

				<span>The energy of Life is found.</span>

			<p>
				<span>Now dewy rain descends, and now</span>

				<span class="i2">Brisk showers the welkin shroud;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I care not, though with angry brow</span>

				<span class="i2">Frowns the red thunder-cloud;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let hail-storm pelt, and lightning harm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>'Tis Nature's work, and has its charm.</span>

				<span>Near the pale recluse's cell,</span>

				<span>Pleasure, wealth, birth, knowledge, power,</span>

				<span><strong>Death</strong> was full urgent with thee, Sister dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">And startling in his speed;—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brief pain, then languor till thy end came near—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">Such was the path decreed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i8">The hurried road</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To lead thy soul from earth to thine own God's abode.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Death wrought with thee, sweet maid, impatiently:—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">Yet merciful the haste</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That baffles sickness;—dearest, thou didst die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">Thou wast not made to taste</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i8">Death's bitterness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Decline's slow-wasting charm, or fever's fierce distress.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Death came unheralded:—but it was well;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">For so thy Saviour bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kind witness, thou wast meet at once to dwell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">On His eternal shore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i8">All warning spared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For none He gives where hearts are for prompt change prepared.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Death wrought in mystery; both complaint and cure</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">To human skill unknown:—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>God put aside all means, to make us sure</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">It was His deed alone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i8">Lest we should lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reproach on our poor selves, that thou wast caught away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Death urged as scant of time:—lest, Sister dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">We many a lingering day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had sicken'd with alternate hope and fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">The ague of delay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i8">Watching each spark</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of promise quench'd in turn, till all our sky was dark.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Death came and went:—that so thy image might</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">Our yearning hearts possess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Associate with all pleasant thoughts and bright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">With youth and loveliness;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i8">Sorrow can claim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mary, nor lot nor part in thy soft soothing name.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Joy of sad hearts, and light of downcast eyes!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">Dearest thou art enshrined</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In all thy fragrance in our memories;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">For we must ever find</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i8">Bare thought of thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Freshen this weary life, while weary life shall be.</span>

				<span>The burst of heart, the o'erflowing glee</span>

				<span class="i1">When only friends were round;</span>

			<p>
				<span>Hope's warmth of promise, prompt to fill</span>

			<p>
				<span>All her eye loved, all her hand press'd</span>

			<p>
				<span>From friend-lit hearth, from social board,</span>

				<br/>
				<span>Gold, and gems, and crispèd hair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fling their light o'er lady fair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>'Tis not waste, nor sinful pride,</span>

				<span>—Name them not, nor fault beside,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But her very cheerfulness</span>

				<span>Prompts and weaves the curious dress;</span>

				<br/>
				<span>And she has a pattern found her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In Nature's glowing world around her.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nature loves, as lady bright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">In gayest guise to shine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All forms of grace, all tints of light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Fringe her robe divine.</span>

				<br/>
				<span>In tranquil diligence pursue</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Their heaven-appointed way.</span>

				<span>Noiseless duties, silent cares,</span>

				<span>Modest influence working good,</span>

				<span>Gifts, by the keen heart understood,</span>

				<span>These they love, in these they live.—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mighty Nature speeds her through</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her daily toils in silence too:</span>

				<span>Churns the sap, matures the fruit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, her deft hand still concealing,</span>

				<span>Kindles motion, life, and feeling.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ladies love to laugh and sing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">To rouse the chord's full sound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or to join the festive ring</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Where dancers gather round.</span>

				<span>Bird and beast of every sort</span>
				<br/>

				<span>Chattering brook, and dancing gnat,</span>

				<span class="i2">Fervid thoughts inspire.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where do wealth and power find rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When hopes have fail'd, or toil oppress'd?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Parks, and lawns, and deer, and trees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nature's work, restore them ease.—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rare the rich, the gifted rare,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where shall work-day souls repair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unennobled, unrefined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the rude world and unkind?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who shall friend their lowly lot?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>High-born Nature answers not.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leave her in her starry dome,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seek we lady-lighted home.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nature 'mid the spheres bears sway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ladies rule where hearts obey.</span>

				<span>Suit a solemn holiday.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Christmas snow, for maiden's bloom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blanched in winter's sudden tomb;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Christmas berries, His red token</span>

				<span>Who that grave's stern seal hath broken;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These for thee the faithful heart,</span>

				<span>How it would be; but time moved slow,</span>

				<span>Along that day of sacred woe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then came the Feast, and we were told</span>

				<span class="i1">Bravely of our best to bring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Myrrh, and frankincense, and gold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As our tribute to our King.</span>

				<span>Now the solemn hours are over</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the Angels round thee hover,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the fanning of their wings</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Keeping time to one who sings</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of high themes consolatory,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the All-loving and His glory,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the age that has no ending,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the day of thy ascending</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From those shades of paradise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the bright supernal skies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thinkest of us, dearest, ever?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ah! so be it nought can sever</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spirit and life, the past and present,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Still we yield thee musings pleasant.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>—God above, and we below;—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So thought ranges, to and fro.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He, in sooth, by tutorings mild,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the rude clay shaped His child,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fiery trial, anguish chill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Served not here His secret will;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But His voice was low and tender,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so true was thy surrender,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the work in haste was done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grace and nature blent in one.—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Harmless thus, and not unmeet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To kiss the dear prints of thy feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tracing thus the narrow road</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All must tread, and Christ has trod.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Loveliest, meekest, blithest, kindest!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lead! we seek the home thou findest!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though thy name to us most dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go! we would not have thee here.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lead, a guiding beacon bright</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To travellers on the Eve of Light.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Welcome aye thy Star before us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring it grief or gladness o'er us;—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Keen regret and tearful yearning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whiles unfelt, and whiles returning;—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or more gracious thoughts abiding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fever-quelling, sorrow-chiding;—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or, when day-light blessings fail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Transport fresh as spice-fraught gale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sparks from thee, which oft have lighted</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weary heart and hope benighted.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I this monument would raise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Distant from the public gaze.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Few will see it;—few e'er knew thee;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But their beating hearts pursue thee,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And their eyes fond thoughts betoken,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though thy name be seldom spoken.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pass on, stranger, and despise it!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These will read, and these will prize it.</span>

				<span>To lavish on the scarring storm!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet we take thee in thy blindness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And we buffet thee in kindness;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Little chary of thy fame,—</span>

				<span><strong>Souls</strong> of the Just, I call not you</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To share this joy with me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This joy and wonder at the view</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of mountain, plain, and sea;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ye, on that loftier mountain old,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Safe lodged in Eden's cell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whence run the rivers four, behold</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This earth, as ere it fell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Or, when ye think of those who stay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Still tried by the world's fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>'Tis but in looking for the day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which shall the lost unite.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ye rather, elder Spirits strong!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who from the first have trod</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This nether scene, man's race among,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The while you live to God,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ye see, and ye can sympathize—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Vain thought! their mighty ken</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fills height and depth, the stars, the skies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They smile at dim-eyed men.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ah, Saviour! I perforce am Thine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Angel and Saint apart:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Those searching Eyes are all-divine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All-human is that Heart.</span>

				<span>Thou, Lord, where'er we lie, canst aid;</span>

				<span>To live as one, will not upbraid</span>

				<span><strong>Now</strong> is the Autumn of the Tree of Life;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Its leaves are shed upon the unthankful earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which lets them whirl, a prey to the winds' strife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Heartless to store them for the months of dearth.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Men close the door, and dress the cheerful hearth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Self-trusting still; and in his comely gear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of precept and of rite, a household Baal rear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But I will out amid the sleet, and view</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each shrivelling stalk and silent-falling leaf.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Truth after truth, of choicest scent and hue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fades, and in fading stirs the Angels' grief,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unanswer'd here; for she, once pattern chief</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of faith, my Country, now gross hearted grown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waits but to burn the stem before her idol's throne.</span>
