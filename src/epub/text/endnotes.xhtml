					<p>The musical character of the verse of "The Dream of Gerontius" is brought out more and more by careful study of the changes of the meaning of the poem and their expression. "The Dream" is a series of lyrics,—each lyric voicing its own feeling and sensitively tuned to that feeling. According to the scansion most in use in English, the first supplicating lyric may be classed as in pentameter iambic. Gerontius is yet in the body, and the rime, used solemnly, marks a difference—which has a delicate symbolism—between his utterances in the body and his utterances when his soul has left the body. What we call blank verse is used by the Spirit—rime disappears, but the rhythm remains the same. Using verse-notation, we find five accented notes in each line, if we consider the lines at all. There are two quarter-notes in each bar, which may be written as</p>

					<p>Gerontius dreams that he is dying. He has not strength to pray. He hears the persons near his bed praying for him, in the language prescribed by the Church, "The Litany for the Dying." The three opening invocations are in Greek, "<i xml:lang="grc">Kyrie Eleison</i>" ("Lord, have mercy"), "<i xml:lang="grc">Christe Eleison</i>" ("Christ, have mercy"), "<i xml:lang="grc">Kyrie Eleison</i>" ("Lord, have mercy"). The next invocation in the Litany is "<i xml:lang="la">Sancta Maria, Ora pro eo</i>," which Cardinal Newman translates into English. With the exception of the first three and the last two invocations, the Litany is in Latin. The Litany is too long for the purpose of the poem, and the author has translated into English some of the invocations that would naturally strike the "fainting soul." "Be merciful" ("<i xml:lang="la">Propitius esto</i>"), the assistants continue, still using parts of the Litany as versified by Cardinal Newman. <a href="the-dream-of-gerontius.xhtml#noteref-18" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
