						<span><strong>Jesu, Maria</strong>—I am near to death,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-18" id="noteref-18" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And Thou art calling me; I know it now—</span>

						<span>Not by the token of this faltering breath,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">This chill at heart, this dampness on my brow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(Jesu, have mercy! Mary, pray for me!)—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">'Tis this new feeling, never felt before,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(Be with me, Lord, in my extremity!)</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">That I am going, that I am no more.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>'Tis this strange innermost abandonment,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">(Lover of souls! great God! I look to Thee,)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This emptying out of each constituent</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And natural force, by which I come to be.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pray for me, O my friends; a visitant</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Is knocking his dire summons at my door,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The like of whom, to scare me and to daunt,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Has never, never come to me before;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>'Tis death,—O loving friends, your prayers!—'tis he!...</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As though my very being had given way,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">As though I was no more a substance now,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And could fall back on nought to be my stay,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">(Help, loving Lord! Thou my sole Refuge, Thou,)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And turn no whither, but must needs decay</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And drop from out the universal frame</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Into that shapeless, scopeless, blank abyss,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">That utter nothingness, of which I came:</span>

						<span>This is it that has come to pass in me;</span>

						<br/>
						<span>Some bodily form of ill</span>

						<span>Floats on the wind, with many a loathsome curse</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tainting the hallowed air, and laughs, and flaps</span>

						<span>I went to sleep;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-28" id="noteref-28" epub:type="noteref">28</a> and now I am refreshed.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A strange refreshment: for I feel in me</span>
						<br/>
						<span>An inexpressive lightness, and a sense</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of freedom, as I were at length myself,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ne'er had been before. How still it is!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I hear no more the busy beat of time,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No, nor my fluttering breath, nor struggling pulse;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor does one moment differ from the next.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I had a dream; yes:—some one softly said</span>
						<br/>
						<span>"He's gone"; and then a sigh went round the room.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And then I surely heard a priestly voice</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cry "Subvenite"; and they knelt in prayer.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I seem to hear him still; but thin and low,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And fainter and more faint the accents come,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As at an ever-widening interval.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ah! whence is this? What is this severance?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This silence pours a solitariness</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Into the very essence of my soul;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And the deep rest, so soothing and so sweet,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hath something too of sternness and of pain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For it drives back my thoughts upon their spring</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By a strange introversion, and perforce</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I now begin to feed upon myself,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Because I have nought else to feed upon.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Am I alive or dead? I am not dead,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But in the body still; for I possess</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A sort of confidence which clings to me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That each particular organ holds its place</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As heretofore, combining with the rest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Into one symmetry, that wraps me round,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And makes me man; and surely I could move,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Did I but will it, every part of me.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And yet I cannot to my sense bring home,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By very trial, that I have the power.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>'Tis strange; I cannot stir a hand or foot,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I cannot make my fingers or my lips</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By mutual pressure witness each to each,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor by the eyelid's instantaneous stroke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Assure myself I have a body still.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor do I know my very attitude,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor if I stand, or lie, or sit, or kneel.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So much I know, not knowing how I know,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That the vast universe, where I have dwelt,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is quitting me, or I am quitting it.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or I or it is rushing on the wings</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of light or lightning on an onward course,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And we e'en now are million miles apart.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet ... is this peremptory severance</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wrought out in lengthening measurements of space,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which grow and multiply by speed and time?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or am I traversing infinity</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By endless subdivision, hurrying back</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From finite towards infinitesimal,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thus dying out of the expansive world?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Another marvel:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-29" id="noteref-29" epub:type="noteref">29</a> someone has me fast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Within his ample palm; 'tis not a grasp</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such as they use on earth, but all around</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Over the surface of my subtle being,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As though I were a sphere, and capable</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To be accosted thus, a uniform</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And gentle pressure tells me I am not</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Self-moving, but borne forward on my way.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And hark! I hear a singing; yet in sooth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I cannot of that music rightly say</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whether I hear or touch or taste the tones.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Oh what a heart-subduing melody!</span>
